				<h1> PIZZAS MASA NAPOLETANA </h1>
				<p> When we talk about Neapolitan Pizza, we are indicating a totally handmade elaboration, where the
					Dough, the Shape, the Ingredients, the Cooking and the Taste express neither more nor less than the
					Heart of Italy. The dough is long-fermented and cold, which makes it tender, and its digestion is
					much easier. The shape is not necessarily round, but with a carefully raised edge. Ingredients of
					the highest quality, tomato sauce crumbled by hand, Mozzarella Fior di latte and other seasonal
					ingredients are combined in just quantities to be able to enjoy and savor each one of them. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="text">
				<h1> WINERIES </h1>

				<P> Our viticulture has more than five centuries of history, integrating the knowledge of the original
					peoples with the tradition of European immigrants, and represents the most important sector industry
					in South America. It began to be produced in Santiago del Estero, from the Moscatel and Uva País
					strains, from Spain. The expansion of its cultivation continued at the hands of the Jesuits and by
					1598 there were vineyards in Córdoba, Santa Fe, Buenos Aires and Misiones. On the other hand,
					Mendoza and San Juan became key sites, since the vines from Chile entered the territory through
					there, which already had a strong wine production at that time. Years later, Domingo Faustino
					Sarmiento introduced Malbec from France. Today it has positioned itself as the emblematic variety of
					Argentina and has more than 43,000 hectares planted. </P>

				<h1> NATURAL JUICE </h1>

				<p> Natural juices improve the well-being of our body thanks to the nutritional properties of fruits and
					vegetables. Among these, fructose that is transformed into a more lasting energy compared to sugar
					and vitamins and minerals that are essential for energy metabolism. The WHO (World Health
					Organization) recommends consuming 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day: the perfect dose for a
					correct diet. Drinking a 150 ml glass of juice extracted from fruit and vegetables is like eating
					one of the 5 daily servings. It is important to consume fruit and vegetables of different colors
					during the day. Specific nutrients correspond to each color, which carry out a protective action,
					which allows us to satisfy all the needs of our body.</p>

			<div class="text">

				<h1> COFFEE </h1>
				<p> Coffee enjoys enormous popularity and is one of the most historic crops in the world. The Arabs were
					the first to discover the virtues and nutritional possibilities of this drink around the fifteenth
					century, which is why it was believed for a long time that the plant was of Arab origin. Arriving in
					America in 1723 in the hands of a French ship's lieutenant, the coffee landed in the Antilles after
					an extensive journey and before the end of the 18th century it was distributed throughout the
					continent. </p>
