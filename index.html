									<h1> PIZZAS MASA NAPOLETANA </h1>

									<p> When we talk about Neapolitan Pizza, we are indicating a totally handmade elaboration, where the
										Dough, the Shape, the Ingredients, the Cooking and the Taste express neither more nor less than the
										Heart of Italy. The dough is long-fermented and cold, which makes it tender, and its digestion is
										much easier. The shape is not necessarily round, but with a carefully raised edge. Ingredients of
										the highest quality, tomato sauce crumbled by hand, Mozzarella Fior di latte and other seasonal
										ingredients are combined in just quantities to be able to enjoy and savor each one of them.
									</p>

								<div class="text">
									<h1> WINERIES </h1>

									<P> Our viticulture has more than five centuries of history, integrating the knowledge of the original
										peoples with the tradition of European immigrants, and represents the most important sector industry
										in South America. It began to be produced in Santiago del Estero, from the Moscatel and Uva País
										strains, from Spain. The expansion of its cultivation continued at the hands of the Jesuits and by
										1598 there were vineyards in Córdoba, Santa Fe, Buenos Aires and Misiones. On the other hand,
										Mendoza and San Juan became key sites, since the vines from Chile entered the territory through
										there, which already had a strong wine production at that time. Years later, Domingo Faustino
										Sarmiento introduced Malbec from France. Today it has positioned itself as the emblematic variety of
										Argentina and has more than 43,000 hectares planted.

									<h1> NATURAL JUICE </h1>
									<p> Natural juices improve the well-being of our body thanks to the nutritional properties of fruits and
										vegetables. Among these, fructose that is transformed into a more lasting energy compared to sugar
										and vitamins and minerals that are essential for energy metabolism. The WHO (World Health
										Organization) recommends consuming 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day: the perfect dose for a
										correct diet. Drinking a 150 ml glass of juice extracted from fruit and vegetables is like eating
										one of the 5 daily servings. It is important to consume fruit and vegetables of different colors
										during the day. Specific nutrients correspond to each color, which carry out a protective action,
										which allows us to satisfy all the needs of our body.
									</p>

								<div class="text">
									<h1> COFFEE </h1>
									<p> Coffee enjoys enormous popularity and is one of the most historic crops in the world. The Arabs were
										the first to discover the virtues and nutritional possibilities of this drink around the fifteenth
										century, which is why it was believed for a long time that the plant was of Arab origin. Arriving in
										America in 1723 in the hands of a French ship's lieutenant, the coffee landed in the Antilles after
										an extensive journey and before the end of the 18th century it was distributed throughout the
										continent.
